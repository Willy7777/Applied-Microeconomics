# How the internet opinion and sentiment  influence the willingness of getting vaccinated? Case of the Moderna covid-19 vaccine (Thesis)

## ABSTRACT
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments around the world actively disseminated the vaccine information and promoted the vaccination to prevent the epidemic. The mis- and dis-information about the vaccination on the internet usually makes people worried and thus decreases the willingness of vaccination. By using the Synthetic Control Method and the OpView data, as well as the AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna, and Medigen vaccines provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, this study investigates the negative causal relationship between the internet public opinion and vaccination. It is helpful to increase the number of people vaccinated by clarifying the causal relationship between internet information and vaccination.
